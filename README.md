# Bufdio
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Bufdio)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bufdio/)

A cross-platform audio playback library that targets .NET Standard 2.1. The main purpose of this project is to provide easy to use API for playing and streaming audio especially in a desktop environment.

This video demonstrate how to integrate Bufdio and [NWaves](https://github.com/ar1st0crat/NWaves/) to create realtime echo effect during playback (source code can be found at [examples directory](https://github.com/luthfiampas/Bufdio/tree/main/examples/BufdioAvalonia)).

[![Bufdio Sample](https://i.ibb.co/ZmJMjJF/2021-11-02-02-46.png)](https://youtu.be/Bx22X20Tkj0)

Behind the scene, it uses [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to decode audio frames (so, it is possible to play video files by taking its audio stream only). And [PortAudio](https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio) for sending buffer data to output device using blocking calls mechanism.

## Getting Started
This repository include pre-compiled PortAudio binaries for Windows, Linux, macOS that can be found at [libs directory](https://github.com/luthfiampas/Bufdio/tree/main/libs/PortAudio) (unfortunately, the Windows binaries does not include ASIO).

```csharp
BufdioLib.InitializePortAudio("path/to/portaudio");
BufdioLib.InitializeFFmpeg("path/to/ffmpeg/libraries");

// Or just use system-wide libraries
BufdioLib.InitializePortAudio();
BufdioLib.InitializeFFmpeg();
```

With PortAudio initialized, now we can retrieve available output devices.

```csharp
var defaultDevice = BufdioLib.DefaultOutputDevice;
Console.WriteLine(defaultDevice.Name);
Console.WriteLine(defaultDevice.MaxOutputChannels);
Console.WriteLine(defaultDevice.DefaultSampleRate);
Console.WriteLine(defaultDevice.DefaultHighOutputLatency);

// Retrieve all available output devices
foreach (var device in BufdioLib.OutputDevices)
{
    Console.WriteLine(device.Name);
}
```

## Playing Audio Files
Bufdio provides high level interface for loading audio and control its playback state. The audio source can be loaded from local file, URL or .NET `System.IO.Stream`.

```csharp
using IAudioPlayer player = new AudioPlayer();

// Methods
player.Load("audio-url");
player.Load(fileStream);
player.Play();
player.Pause();
player.Stop();
player.SetVolume(0.9f);
player.Seek(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));

// Properties (read-only)
var state = player.CurrentState; // (Playing, Buferring, Paused, Stopped)
var loaded = player.IsAudioLoaded;
var duration = player.TotalDuration;
var position = player.CurrentPosition;
var volume = player.CurrentVolume;

// Events
player.AudioLoaded += OnAudioLoaded;
player.StateChanged += OnStateChanged;
player.PositionChanged += OnPositionChanged;
player.PlaybackCompleted += OnPlaybackCompleted;
player.LogCreated += OnLogCreated;
player.FrameDecoded += OnFrameDecoded;
player.FramePresented += OnFramePresented;
```

The `AudioPlayer` constructor allows you to specify list of custom sample processors. `ISampleProcessor` interface is intended to modify audio sample that will be executed before writing audio frame to output device. The most simple processor is `VolumeProcessor` that simply multiply given sample by desired volume.

```csharp
var processors = new ISampleProcessor[] { new EchoProcessor(), new DistortionProcessor() };
using IAudioPlayer player = new AudioPlayer(customProcessors: processors);
```

## Generate Sine Wave
Bufdio also exposes low level `IAudioEngine` interface for sending or writing samples to native output device.

```csharp
const int SampleRate = 8000;
const float Frequency = 350f;
const float Amplitude = 0.35f * short.MaxValue;

var samples = new float[SampleRate];
var options = new AudioEngineOptions(1, SampleRate);

using IAudioEngine engine = new PortAudioEngine(options);

for (var i = 0; i < samples.Length; i++)
{
    samples[i] = (float)(Amplitude * Math.Sin(2 * Math.PI * i * Frequency / SampleRate));
}

Console.WriteLine("Playing 10 times with 1 second delay..");

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    engine.Send(samples);
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
}
```

## TODO
- Currently only resampling to `Float32` format
- Still need more unit tests
